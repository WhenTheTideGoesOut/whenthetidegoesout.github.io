			<description>Approach to SQL Queries In this post I want to address an useful approach on how to attempt SQL queries. In the previous posts we have looked at the setting up a local SQL environent for you to practice on and then how SQL statements are structured. Please feel free to go back and have a quick read.
Now on to the issue at hand. How to approach an SQL query.</description>

<p>In this post I want to address an useful approach on how to attempt SQL queries. In the previous posts we have looked at the setting up a local SQL environent for you to practice on and then how SQL statements are structured. Please feel free to go back and have a quick read.</p>
<p>Now on to the issue at hand. How to approach an SQL query.</p>
<h2 id="1-start-at-the-beginning">1) Start at the beginning.</h2>
<p>This may sound a bit facetious but it is not. What I mena is start with the problem you are trying to resolve. What is the question you are trying to ask of the DBMS.</p>
<p>Now the question or problem you are trying to resolve may come originate from a colleague. In which case a meeting will be needed. Things to understand.</p>
<pre><code>1. What is the question.
2. Why are you or why are they asking the question.
3. What is their expectation of the result.
4. What is the result going to be used for, what will it support.
</code></pre>
<p>While the first question is obvious, it is important and equally the remaining three questions inform the first and can help refine and restructure the question to better resolve the actual problem.</p>
<h2 id="2-understand-the-data">2) Understand the Data</h2>
<p>This may be a mute point given your experience and understanding of the data set in question. If you have been working with the database  day in day out for many years, then it is probably a given that you understand the data. We will progress any way.</p>
<p>When we say understand the data what we mean is to understand the following:</p>
<pre><code>1. The objective of the database at hand.
2. The schema of the database. By this we mean how the different table relate. The primary key field(s). What each table represents.
3. The Data Dictionary, once you understand the objective of the database and the schema or structure of it. It is important to understand the attribute within each of the tables. The rules they must follow etc.
</code></pre>
<p>This point could potentially come before the first in, start at the beginning. It could also be a given and not necessary for every problem.</p>
<p>The next step is to explore the dataset.</p>
<h2 id="3-explore-the-data">3. Explore the Data.</h2>
<p>While at the outset it might seem that if you are working with the database day in day out and have many years experience, this may not be necessary. I believe however, that as the database changes and as the data within it changes this will still need to be completed.</p>
<p>The objective of this step is to help build an understanding that would allow you to build the right query to resolve the problem.</p>
<p>If we assume we are working within the one, known database then commands such as:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>SHOW TABLES;</code> will list out all of the tables within the database. You should be able to see the tables described in the schema &lsquo;live&rsquo; within the database.</li>
<li><code>DESCRIBE [table name];</code> will list out the field formats within the table. This should reflect to what is in the datadictionary.</li>
<li><code>SHOW COLUMNS FROM [table name]</code> will show the field names or column names from the table name supplied.</li>
<li><code>SELECT COUNT (*) FROM [table name]</code> will return the number of records in a given table.</li>
<li><code>SELECT * FROM [table name] WHERE [col name] IS NULL OR [col-name] = '';</code>  will return all the rows that have a null or emplty value in the field that was specified by <code>[col name]</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are many ways to explore the data within the database but these are a good starting point. These can help with the next step which is to start to think about what the solution will look like.</p>
<h2 id="4-vizualize-the-solution">4. Vizualize the Solution</h2>
<p>Now that we have</p>

			<description>Order of Operation Before we get started on using SQL for Business Analytics we need to understand how SQL works.
You will notice there are different versions of SQL out there and each of these work slightly differently. We won&amp;rsquo;t be going into the differences. We are using MySQL for this blog. MySQL is an Open Source version of SQL that is supported by Oracle.
If you search for SQL in wikipedia (https://en.</description>

<p>Before we get started on using SQL for Business Analytics we need to understand how SQL works.</p>
<p>You will notice there are different versions of SQL out there and each of these work slightly differently. We won&rsquo;t be going into the differences. We are using MySQL for this blog. MySQL is an Open Source version of SQL that is supported by Oracle.</p>
<p>If you search for SQL in wikipedia (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_syntax">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_syntax</a>) it suggests that the languange is subdvided into language elements. These are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Keywords</strong> These include items such as <code>SELECT</code> or <code>FROM</code>. They can either be reserved (like <code>SELECT</code>) or non-reserved (<code>ASC</code>)</li>
<li><strong>Identifiers</strong> These are database objects, like the database name or a table name. If the name is also a <strong>keyword</strong> then the user will have to enter the word in quote marks. For example, YEAR could be a column name, but as it is a <strong>keyword</strong> when using it it shoul be used as <code>&quot;YEAR&quot;</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Clauses</strong> Are constituent parts of statements and queries</li>
<li><strong>Expressions</strong> Produce scalar values or tables of data.</li>
<li><strong>Queries</strong> Retrieve data based on specific criteria from a database. An important elemtn of SQL.</li>
<li><strong>Statements</strong> May have a persistent effect on schemata and data, or may control transactions, program flow, connections, sessions, or diagnostics. Statements terminate with a semicolon (<code>;</code>). Not requried on every platform, but is a standard part of the grammar.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="order-of-execution">Order of Execution</h2>
<p>To understand how SQL works, it is important to understand the oder the of operations. This will help with both designing the statemetns and debugging statemetns.</p>
<p>If we take an example.</p>
<pre><code>SELECT field_name_1 field_name_2
FROM table_1
WHERE field_name_1 = value_1
GROUP BY field_name_1
HAVING condition
ORDER BY field_name_1
LIMIT 5;
</code></pre><ol>
<li>From is the first statement executed. We need to know where to begin. Generally this is a table, so first we take a table.</li>
<li>Where is the second statement conpleted, with it we filter the table we have just identified.</li>
<li>Group by, is the next, the third statement. This aggregates the base data.</li>
<li>Having, is the fourth statement completed. It is only used to filter the aggregated data - only used with the Group By.</li>
<li>Select, the fifth statement completed. It selects the fields to be presented.</li>
<li>Order By, the sixth statement - sorts the final fields selected.</li>
<li>Limit, the seventh and last statement - this limits the number of records returned.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the next few blog posts I will go through common &ldquo;how to&rsquo;s&rdquo; Such as your first query, aggregation and dates among others.</p>

			<description>SQL - First the Why Why would you want to get to know and use SQL.
The Background Well Structured Query Language or SQL is the way we get data from relational databases.
There is a lot in that statement but lets break it down. Relational databases first came on the scene in the 1970&amp;rsquo;s when Edgar F. Codd when working for IBM led the development of System R, whic hwas the database software.</description>

<p>Why would you want to get to know and use SQL.</p>
<h3 id="the-background">The Background</h3>
<p>Well Structured Query Language or SQL is the way we get data from relational databases.</p>
<p>There is a lot in that statement but lets break it down. Relational databases first came on the scene in the 1970&rsquo;s when Edgar F. Codd when working for IBM led the development of System R, whic hwas the database software. To manage the data in Systeam R SEQUEL, later just called SQL although this too can be pronounded SEQUEL, was invented.</p>
<p>In 1979 a company called Relational Software created a related product called Oracle V2 after seeing the potential of System R, this was successful and is the begginnings of what we ave today.</p>
<p>We are not going to get into Normal form and what he described, but suffice to say he designed away of efficiently and accurately storing data and also, importantly for us, retrieveing the data.</p>
<p>This led to Relational Databases which are collections of related data joined through primary keys and foreign keys. These goups of tables are managed by databases management systems or DBMS. to get to the data and maniputlate the data we use SQL or Structured Query Language.</p>
<h3 id="sql-getting-started">SQL Getting Started</h3>
<p>To get started we need to install SQL Server and some sort of client to work with the server. I am using a desktop computer ( a mid 2012 MacBook Air )</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Install the server from here -&gt; <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/">https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/</a>
Paying close attention to the version of the operating system you are running. Note I am using the community edition and due to the age of my laptop I am using version 8.0.22</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next install the client to work with the server. I am going to use MySQL Work Bench given that I am using MySQL Server. The download can be found here -&gt; <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/workbench/en/wb-installing-mac.html">https://dev.mysql.com/doc/workbench/en/wb-installing-mac.html</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now that we have the server and the client we need some data&hellip; there a couple of options. The one that i have gone with is a test.db from datacharmer here is a link to the github repository. <a href="https://github.com/datacharmer/test_db">https://github.com/datacharmer/test_db</a>. To set up my database I clicked on the &lsquo;Code&rsquo; dropdowna and clicked on the download zip file.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Once downloaded I extraced the zip to the folder that I wanted to work in. I have an &lsquo;SQL&rsquo; folder in my documents.</p>
<p>I then  opened Terminal navigated to the SQL folder and ran the <code>employees.sql</code> using the <code>mysql &lt; employees_partitioned.sql</code>.</p>
<p>Once that is complete you can go into MySQL Workbench.</p>
<p>Click on the plus sign beside the title &lsquo;MySQL Connections&rsquo;.  Fill out the details and locate the &lsquo;dump&rsquo; files and connect. Hey presto we have a databse.</p>
<p>In the next couple of blogs we will go through how to use SQL for business analytics and business intelligence.  As I result I will not be doing any <code>create</code>, <code>update</code> and <code>drop</code> etc. I will be focusing on using <code>select</code> as the basis of the queries, this is because this is what I primarily use. This is what we need to use SQL for business analytics.</p>
